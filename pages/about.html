                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle
are a diverse group of people
who share a common interest in Irish literature.
Some of us were born in Ireland,
some of us are of Irish descent,
and some of us are honorary&nbsp;Irish!</p>
<p>Originally, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese">Flight of the Wild Geese</a>
referred to thousands of Irish soldiers who were exiled to France
after the Treaty of Limerick in 1691.
For generations, their descendants served in
the Irish Brigades in continental European&nbsp;armies.</p>
<p>More generally, the term &#8220;Wild Geese&#8221; has become synonymous with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora">Irish diaspora</a>.</p>
<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle were formed in 1998
by Dr Kieran O&#8217;Malley,
following an earlier incarnation of the Wild Geese in&nbsp;Edmonton.</p>
