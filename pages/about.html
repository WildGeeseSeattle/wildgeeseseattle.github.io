                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle are a diverse group of people who
share a common interest in Irish literature.
Some of us were born in Ireland,
some of us are of Irish descent,
and some of us are honorary&nbsp;Irish!</p>
<p>Originally, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese">Flight of the Wild Geese</a>
referred to thousands of Irish soldiers who were exiled to France
after the Treaty of Limerick in 1691.
For generations, their descendants served in the Irish Brigades in the French army,
fighting against&nbsp;England.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://indigo.ie/~wildgees/index.htm">Wild Geese Heritage Museum</a>
of Portumna, Co. Galway has a large collection of Wild Geese&nbsp;material.</p>
<p>More generally, the term &#8220;Wild Geese&#8221; has become synonymous with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora">Irish diaspora</a>.</p>
<p>Here are past and current members of the&nbsp;Players.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Bill&nbsp;Barnes</h3>

the Global War on Terror. In real life he works at <span class="caps">UW</span> School of Nursing

<h3>Olivia&nbsp;Bermingham-McDonogh</h3>
<p>Olivia Bermingham-McDonogh was born in Tuam, Co. Galway
and came to the <span class="caps">USA</span> for graduate school at <span class="caps">UCLA</span>.
Other than the required school plays,
she has never performed in anything
other than the annual Bloomsday reading of Ulysses.
She is a Professor at the University of Washington;
her research area is development and regeneration of the inner ear.
She has now spent half her life in the <span class="caps">US</span>
and wonders if she will ever find her way back&nbsp;home!</p>

<hr>
<h3>Helen&nbsp;Brew</h3>
<p>Helen Brew has performed with the Wild Geese Players since June 2000
(which was chapter 4). In her youth she was an avid reader and artist,
though she fitted in bits of acting, stage writing, directing, theatre
design and choral performance. Her paid work has included writing a book
on compost, and doing neuroscience research (<span class="caps">UW</span>). She&#8217;s English, but has
some Irish ancestry she tries to play up. She directed 2007&#8217;s&nbsp;reading.</p>

attended the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, the Cooper
Union in New York and completed the Scientific Illustration program at
the University of Washington in 2004. She is currently working on

<hr>
<p><img alt="Maura Donegan" src="https://www.WildGeeseSeattle.org/images/Maura_Donegan.jpg"></p>

(Edmonton) assisting with costumes. Her interests include textiles and
embroidery. Maura is from Ireland. She has three children whom she
educated at&nbsp;home.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Iain&nbsp;Edgewater</h3>
<p>Iain Edgewater was raised on the fringes of Appalachia in Kentucky, and
was first exposed to Joyce in boyhood, strangely, through science
fiction. After years of reading Ulysses in bits and pieces, he finally
read it straight through while living in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1992&#8212;a very
good time and place for the task. Like many trained in anthropology, he
does not work as an anthropologist; instead, he is now one of the people
involved with occasionally rebooting your computer in the middle of the
night, if you happen to use a rather well-known operating system. After
much time threatening to begin writing fiction (concurrent with early
dabbling in acting, and later involvement in radio), he is finally doing
so, and is thus pleased to have finally begun reading with the <span class="caps">WGP</span> in
this cycle&#8212;since the shadow of Joyce looms large over his&nbsp;efforts.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Claudia&nbsp;Finn</h3>
<p>Claudiaâ€™s Irish ancestors came to the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> in 1872 (!). A theatre buff,
Francophile, and James Joyce fan, she joined the Wild Geese in 2008.
After a career writing, producing, and directing corporate videos,
multimedia, and print, she taught college courses in business and
technology. Since moving to Seattle in 2003, she works as a technical
trainer, training developer, writer and&nbsp;editor.</p>

practiced nephrology in Boston and New Mexico before coming to the
Northwest. 2008 will be his first reading with the Wild&nbsp;Geese.</p>
