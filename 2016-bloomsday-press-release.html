<p>The <a href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/index.html">Wild Geese Players of
Seattle</a> join Bloomsday
celebrations across the globe honoring Ulysses&#8217; author James Joyce. Our
19th annual staged reading of selections from the book will be held on
Sunday, June 19, 2016 from 2–4 <span class="caps">PM</span> at the <a href="http://www.spl.org/calendar-of-events">Seattle Central
Library</a>, 1000 Fourth Ave,
Seattle, <span class="caps">WA</span> 98104, Level 4 – Room 2 – Howard S. Wright Family <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Janet W.
Ketcham Meeting&nbsp;Room.</p>
<p>Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for Ulysses’ main character, Leopold
Bloom) is a worldwide commemoration and celebration of the life of Irish
writer James Joyce and refers to the 24-hour period in 1904 in which
Ulysses is set. Ulysses follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish
everyman, and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce&#8217;s alter ego, as
they wander the streets of&nbsp;Dublin.</p>
<p>Join us for a taste of Ulysses, in small bites. This year’s reading
features Chapter 3, “Proteus”, and Chapter 6, “Hades”. In the book, both
chapters take place around 11 am. In Chapter 3 Stephen has wandered down
to Sandymount Strand (the beach at the southeast side of Dublin) to
stroll and to think. He contemplates different theories of vision,
Aristotle&#8217;s in particular, and remembers his adventures in Paris before
his mother&nbsp;died.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Chapter 6 we join the funeral of Paddy Dignam, with Bloom
sharing a carriage with Simon Dedalus (father of Stephen) and others to
Glasnevin cemetery. As the carriage moves past Watery Lane, Bloom sees
Stephen and points him out to Simon Dedalus. Bloom&#8217;s Jewish parentage
makes him an outsider to the Catholics in the cab, and the conversation
takes some awkward&nbsp;turns.</p>
<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle have presented staged readings of
Irish literature, by writers such as James Joyce and <span class="caps">W.B.</span> Yeats, since
1998. We are a diverse group of people with an interest in Irish
literature, and most of us are either Irish-born or have Irish
connections. We believe that poetry and certain novels are best read
aloud, that some words are better heard than&nbsp;read.</p>
