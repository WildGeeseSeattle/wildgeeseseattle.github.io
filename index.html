<h1>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle</h1>

<p>We believe that poetry and certain novels are best read aloud,
that some words are better heard than read.
Every year, we perform a staged reading of part of James Joyce's novel
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)">Ulysses</a>.
Occasionally, we do other readings too.</p>

<p>Ulysses takes place on June 16th, 1904,
the date now known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday">Bloomsday</a>.
It follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman, and
Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's <em>alter ego</em>,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.
The centenary of Bloomsday, June 16th, 2004, was celebrated worldwide.</p>


<h1>Yeats' 150th Anniversary Reading: Oct 18</h1>

<p>2015 is the 150th anniversary of the birth of
William Butler Yeats, one of Ireland's greatest poets.
We will present a 
<a href="./Yeats/2015/150-reading.html" title="Yeats 150">
reading of Yeats' work</a>.

<h2>The Players</h2>

<p>
The Wild Geese Players of Seattle have been staging readings
of Irish literature, by writers such as
<a href="./Joyce/index.html">James Joyce</a>
and
<a href="./Yeats/index.html">W.B.&nbsp;Yeats</a>,
in Seattle since 1998.
We are a diverse group of people with an interest in Irish literature,
and most of us are either Irish-born or have Irish connections.
More generally, the Wild Geese refers to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora">Irish diaspora</a>,
after the original
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese">Wild Geese</a>,
exiled Irish soldiers and their descendants who served in 
European armies in the 16th–18th centuries.
