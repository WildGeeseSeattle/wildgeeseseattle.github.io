<h1>The Players</h1>

<p>Originally, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese">
Flight of the Wild Geese</a>
referred to thousands of Irish soldiers who were exiled to France
after the Treaty of Limerick in 1691. For generations, their
descendants served in the Irish Brigades in the French army,
fighting against England.</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://indigo.ie/~wildgees/index.htm">
Wild Geese Heritage Museum</a> of Portumna, Co. Galway
has a large collection of Wild Geese material.
</p>

<p>More generally, the term "Wild Geese" has become synonymous with the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora">
Irish diaspora</a>.</p>

<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle are a diverse group of people
who share a common interest in Irish literature.
Some of us were born in Ireland, some of us are of Irish descent,
and some of us are honorary Irish!</p>

<p>
Here are past and current members of the Players.

<a name="Iain Edgewater">
<h3>Iain Edgewater</h3>
</a>

<p>
Iain Edgewater was raised on the fringes of Appalachia in Kentucky, and was 
first exposed to Joyce in boyhood, strangely, through science fiction.  After 
years of reading Ulysses in bits and pieces, he finally read it straight 
through while living in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1992--a very good time and place for 
the task.  Like many trained in anthropology, he does not work as an 
anthropologist; instead, he is now one of the people involved with occasionally 
rebooting your computer in the middle of the night, if you happen to use a 
rather well-known operating system.  After much time threatening to begin 
writing fiction (concurrent with early dabbling in acting, and later 
involvement in radio), he is finally doing so, and is thus pleased to have 
finally begun reading with the WGP in this cycle--since the shadow of Joyce 
looms large over his efforts.
