<h1>Poetry and Music of Revolution and Evolution</h1>

<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present an evening of
"Poetry and Music of Revolution and Evolution"
on Saturday, November 6th, 2004 at 8 pm,
at the Brechemin Auditorium, School of Music, University of Washington.
Donations at the door.</p>

<p>The evening will incorporate poetry, prose, and music
from 1776 to 1916 and beyond,
including excerpts from works by
<a href="./Yeats/index.html">W.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Yeats</a>,
Pádraic Pearse, Seán O'Casey, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman,
Stephen Crane, Bob Dylan,
and other writers, both Irish and American.</p>

<p>The thrust of the evening is inspired by these lines from an address
by President John F. Kennedy, given at Amherst College Convocation
on October 26th, 1963, one month before he died:</p>

<blockquote>
"When power leads man towards arrogance,
poetry reminds him of his limitations.
When power narrows the area of man's concern,
poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of existence"
</blockquote>

<p>These are times that will be remembered for many years to come,
and we all have an opportunity to acknowledge their importance
and reflect on their legacy for America and for the world.</p>

<p>Kieran Darragh O'Malley<br />
Artistic Director</p>
