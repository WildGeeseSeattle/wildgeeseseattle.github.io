<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will perform a staged reading of
Part <span class="caps">II</span> of <em>Circe</em>, chapter 15 of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>,
on Wednesday, June 16th, 2010, 7:00-9:15pm,

<p>It is late on the night of June 16th, 1904, and Leopold Bloom has
followed Stephen Dedalus into Dublin&#8217;s red-light district. Bloom has a
paternal concern for Stephen&#8217;s welfare and knows that Stephen is now
very drunk. In the <em>Circe</em> chapter of Homer&#8217;s <em>Odyssey</em>, the
witch-goddess Circe transforms Odysseus&#8217; crew into swine. In Joyce&#8217;s
version, Bloom will have hallucinatory encounters with the denizens of
Nighttown and confront some of his deepest fantasies and fears, before
emerging victorious. This chapter is extraordinarily long. We performed
the first half <a href="../2009.html">last year</a>.</p>
<p>The Wild Geese have been staging readings of Ulysses and other Irish
literature in Seattle since 1998. We are a diverse group of people with
an interest in Irish literature, and most of us are either Irish-born or
have Irish connections. More generally, Wild Geese refers to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora">Irish
diaspora</a>, after the
original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese">Wild
Geese</a>, exiled
Irish soldiers and their descendants who served in European armies in
the 16th–18th&nbsp;centuries.</p>

<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
chapter 14, &#8220;Oxen of the Sun&#8221;,
adapted from the 1922 edition of <em>Ulysses</em>.
The reading will take place at the
<a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/">Elliott Bay Bookstore</a>, 101 S. Main St,
on Sat 14th June 2008 at&nbsp;4:00pm.</p>
<p>The wandering Leopold Bloom visits a maternity hospital,
where poor Mina Purefoy is entering her 3rd day of labor.
Bloom encounters a group of drunken medical students,
who carry on wildly
while discussing poor Mrs. Purefoy&#8217;s&nbsp;fate.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Joyce&#8217;s incomparable narrative
celebrates the history of the English language
through elaborate parodies and structures.
At the same time, he reveals much about contemporary attitudes surrounding pregnancy and&nbsp;birth.</p>
