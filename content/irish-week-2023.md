As part of [Seattle's Irish Week](https://irishclub.org/irish-week-2023/),
the Wild Geese Players will be reading an hour-long selection of Irish literature.
In honor of the centenary of William Butler Yeats
winning the Nobel Prize in Literature,
we are celebrating Ireland's Nobel laureates for literature:
W.B. Yeats (1923),
George Bernard Shaw (1925),
Samuel Beckett (1969),
and Seamus Heaney (1995).

Our reading is part of the weekend-long
Irish Festival at the Seattle Center Armory.
Join us in the *Upper Level* from 2â€“3pm on Saturday, March 11th, 2023.
