The Wild Geese Players of Seattle
are a diverse group of people
who share a common interest in Irish literature.
Some of us were born in Ireland,
some of us are of Irish descent,
and some of us are honorary Irish!

Originally, the [Flight of the Wild Geese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese)
referred to thousands of Irish soldiers who were exiled to France
after the Treaty of Limerick in 1691.
For generations, their descendants served in
the Irish Brigades in continental European armies.

More generally, the term "Wild Geese" has become synonymous with the
[Irish diaspora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora).
