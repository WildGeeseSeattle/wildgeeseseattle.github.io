Title: The Wild Geese Players of Seattle
Date: 2018-04-15 17:20

We believe that poetry and certain novels are best read aloud,
that some words are better heard than read.
Every year, we perform a staged reading of part of James Joyce's novel
[Ulysses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)).
Occasionally, we do other readings too.

*Ulysses* takes place on June 16th, 1904, the date now known as
[Bloomsday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday).
The book follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's *alter ego*,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.
The centenary of Bloomsday, June 16th, 2004, was celebrated worldwide.

# The Players

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle have been staging readings of Irish literature,
by writers such as [James Joyce]({filename}Joyce/index.md) and
[W.B. Yeats]({filename}Yeats/index.md),
in Seattle since 1998.
We are a [diverse group of people]({filename}/pages/about.md)
with an interest in Irish literature,
and most of us are either Irish-born or have Irish connections.
More generally, the Wild Geese refers to the
[Irish diaspora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora),
after the original
[Wild Geese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese),
exiled Irish soldiers and their descendants who served in European armies in
the 16th—18th centuries.
