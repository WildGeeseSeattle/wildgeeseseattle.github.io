# Seattle Bloomsday

James Joyce's novel *Ulysses* takes place on June 16th, 1904.
It follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman, and Stephen Dedalus,
a young writer and Joyce's *alter ego*, as they wander the streets of Dublin.

The centenary of Bloomsday, June 16th, 2004, was celebrated worldwide.

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a [staged
reading]({filename}Bloomsday/2014.md "The Other Bloomsday") of *Ulysses*,
chapter 1, “Telemachus”, and chapter 4, “Calypso”, on Sun 15th June
2014, at the Seattle Central Library.
