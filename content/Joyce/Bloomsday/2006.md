The Other Bloomsday - Seattle 2006
==================================

[![](../../images/giant-2.jpg)](http://www.georgevreilly.com/bloomsday/giant.jpg "Download Cyclops Poster (3.6MB)")

James Joyce's novel *Ulysses* takes place on June 16th, 1904. It follows
the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman, and Stephen Dedalus,
a young writer and Joyce's *alter ego*, as they wander the streets of
Dublin.

The centenary of [Bloomsday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday),
June 16th, 2004, was celebrated
[worldwide](http://www.rejoycedublin2004.com "ReJoyce Dublin 2004").

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
chapter 12, "Cyclops", adapted from the 1922 edition of *Ulysses*. The
reading will take place at [F.X.
McRory's](http://www.fxmcrorys.com/fx.html) on Fri 16th June 2006 at
8pm.
