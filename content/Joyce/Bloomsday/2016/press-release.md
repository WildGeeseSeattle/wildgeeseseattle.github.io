# 19th Annual Staged Reading / Bloomsday Celebration of James Joyce’s Ulysses

The [Wild Geese Players of Seattle](https://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/) join Bloomsday
celebrations across the globe honoring Ulysses' author James Joyce. Our
19th annual staged reading of selections from the book will be held on
Sunday, June 19, 2016 from 2–4 PM at the [Seattle Central
Library](https://www.spl.org/calendar-of-events), 1000 Fourth Ave,
Seattle, WA 98104, Level 4 – Room 2 – Howard S. Wright Family & Janet W.
Ketcham Meeting Room.

Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for Ulysses’ main character, Leopold
Bloom) is a worldwide commemoration and celebration of the life of Irish
writer James Joyce and refers to the 24-hour period in 1904 in which
Ulysses is set. Ulysses follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish
everyman, and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego, as
they wander the streets of Dublin.

Join us for a taste of Ulysses, in small bites. This year’s reading
features Chapter 3, “Proteus”, and Chapter 6, “Hades”. In the book, both
chapters take place around 11 am. In Chapter 3 Stephen has wandered down
to Sandymount Strand (the beach at the southeast side of Dublin) to
stroll and to think. He contemplates different theories of vision,
Aristotle's in particular, and remembers his adventures in Paris before
his mother died.

Meanwhile, in Chapter 6 we join the funeral of Paddy Dignam, with Bloom
sharing a carriage with Simon Dedalus (father of Stephen) and others to
Glasnevin cemetery. As the carriage moves past Watery Lane, Bloom sees
Stephen and points him out to Simon Dedalus. Bloom's Jewish parentage
makes him an outsider to the Catholics in the cab, and the conversation
takes some awkward turns.

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle have presented staged readings of
Irish literature, by writers such as James Joyce and W.B. Yeats, since
1998. We are a diverse group of people with an interest in Irish
literature, and most of us are either Irish-born or have Irish
connections. We believe that poetry and certain novels are best read
aloud, that some words are better heard than read.
