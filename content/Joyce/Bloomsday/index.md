The Other Bloomsday - Seattle
=============================

![[James Joyce]](../images/jj1.jpg)

James Joyce's novel *Ulysses* takes place on June 16th, 1904. It follows
the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman, and Stephen Dedalus,
a young writer and Joyce's *alter ego*, as they wander the streets of
Dublin.

The centenary of Bloomsday, June 16th, 2004, was celebrated worldwide.

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a [staged
reading](./2018.html "The Other Bloomsday") of *Ulysses*, the second
half of Chapter 8, “Lestrygonians”, and Chapter 9, "Scylla and
Charybdis", at TBD.

This is our twenty-first year of Bloomsday readings.
