James Joyce's novel *Ulysses* takes place on June 16th, 1904. It follows
the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman, and Stephen Dedalus,
a young writer and Joyce's *alter ego*, as they wander the streets of
Dublin.

The centenary of Bloomsday, June 16th, 2004, was celebrated worldwide.

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a
[staged reading]({filename}Joyce/Bloomsday/2018.md "The Other Bloomsday")
of *Ulysses*,
the second half of Chapter 8, “Lestrygonians”,
and Chapter 9, “Scylla and Charybdis”,
at Seattle Central Library.

This is our twenty-first year of Bloomsday readings.
