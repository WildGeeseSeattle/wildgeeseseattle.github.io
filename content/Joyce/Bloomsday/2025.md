Bloomsday (Bloom's day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904
in which *Ulysses* is set.
Joyce's ground-breaking novel follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

In Episode 15, it is around midnight,
and Stephen Dedalus and his friend Lynch, both very drunk,
have entered Nighttown, Dublin’s red-light district,
in search of female companionship.
Leopold Bloom, who has some paternal feelings for Stephen,
has followed them.
This chapter is full of hallucinations and nightmares,
where Bloom confronts many of his unspoken desires
and emerges strengthened.

The Circe episode is enormously long.
We are reading the **second half** this year,
having read the first half [last year]({filename}2024.md).

Note: this chapter is intended for an **adult audience**.
Bloom will be excoriated and sexually humiliated by the brothel's madam.

### The meaning of Circe

The structure of James Joyce’s Ulysses is loosely based on **Homer’s Odyssey**,
in which the hero Odysseus wandered around the ancient Mediterranean for decades
longing to get home to his wife Penelope.
Joyce’s Odysseus/Ulysses is **Leopold Bloom**, a slightly pathetic jewish Everyman
wandering around his native **Dublin** on **June 16th** 1904.
He feels bad because his wife **Molly** is being unfaithful and
their marriage has been sexless for many years,
since their baby son **Rudy** died.
At the end of the previous episode, [Oxen of the Sun]({filename}2008.md),
Bloom felt protective and fatherly towards **Stephen Dedalus**, the son of a friend.

In **Homer’s Circe** episode,
**Odysseus** maintains his wits and uses
the herb [moly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moly_(herb)),
as advised by the god Hermes,
to avoid being unmanned
during his seduction by the goddess Circe
who has enticed his men with song and feasting
before transforming them into pigs.
She falls in love with Odysseus, reverses the spell on his men
and they feast for a year before she helps them on their way home.

The Circe story above inspires Joyce’s schema for his chapter,
which includes **magic, whore, hallucination, man-hating ogress, and personification**.
A major theme is that sexuality degrades men to the level of dumb unconscious swine…
note the multiple references to pigs.
The Homeric transformation to pigs may actually refer to anticholinergic intoxication,
producing amnesia, hallucinations, and delusions, and counteracted by the snowdrop flower,
fitting the description of moly.
There are some references to Bloom being womanly,
hinting at the overt gender transformations in the second half of the chapter.
**Joyce’s usual multitude of voices** are relatively easy to discern
because the text is written like a **play**,
though depiction of the many hallucinatory sequences and extreme transformations
would require ultramodern animation techniques.
