# 22nd Annual Staged Reading / Bloomsday Celebration of James Joyce’s Ulysses

The [Wild Geese Players of Seattle](http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/)
join Bloomsday celebrations across the globe honoring *Ulysses'* author James Joyce.
Our 22nd annual **staged reading** of a chapter from the book will be held
on Bloomsday, Sunday, June 16th at 2:00pm
in the Microsoft Auditorium at the [Seattle Central Library](http://www.spl.org/calendar-of-events),
1000 Fourth Ave, Seattle, WA 98104.
We will also be reading excerpts
at 6:00pm on Friday, June 14th,
at [Folio Seattle](http://www.folioseattle.org/), 93 Pike St #307, Seattle, WA 98101.

Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
is a worldwide commemoration and celebration of the life of Irish writer, James Joyce
and refers to the 24-hour period of 16th June 1904 in which *Ulysses* is set.
The book follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

## Chapter 10: Wandering Rocks

Chapter 10, The Wandering Rocks, will be performed.
This chapter has been described as a labyrinth that summarizes the day so far,
and gives premonitions of the tale to come!
This is the central chapter of Joyce's book, offered in 19 interlocking scenes,
as ordinary Dubliners across the city interact in mid-afternoon.
