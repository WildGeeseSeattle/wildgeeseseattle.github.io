James Joyce's novel *Ulysses* takes place on June 16th, 1904.
It follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's *alter ego*,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

The centenary of [Bloomsday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday),
June 16th, 2004, was celebrated
[worldwide](http://www.rejoycedublin2004.com "ReJoyce Dublin 2004").

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present staged readings of
chapter 11, "Sirens", adapted from the 1922 edition of *Ulysses*.
The readings will take place at the
