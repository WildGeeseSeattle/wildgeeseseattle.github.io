# 24th Annual Staged Reading / Virtual Bloomsday Celebration of James Joyce’s Ulysses

The [Wild Geese Players of Seattle](https://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/)
join Bloomsday celebrations across the globe honoring *Ulysses'* author James Joyce.
Our annual reading will be presented online
and available for all to stream on Bloomsday, June 16, 2021
at [WildGeeseSeattle.org](https://www.WildGeeseSeattle.org/).

Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904 in which *Ulysses* is set.
*Ulysses* follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

Join us online for Chapter 12, *Cyclops*, where it is 5pm
and a variety of Dublin characters take up space in Barney Kiernan's pub.
Join Leopold Bloom (an outsider),
the Citizen (a xenophobe),
Garryowen (a cur),
the Narrator (a curmudgeon),
Joe Hynes (a ne'er-do-well),
Alf Bergan (a drinker),
Bob Doran (a drunk),
Terry (a barman),
and others
at the bar
for conversation and flights of fantasy.

Since 1998, The Wild Geese Players of Seattle
have presented staged readings of Irish literature,
by writers such as James Joyce and W.B. Yeats.
The Geese are a diverse group of people
who share an interest in matters Irish.
Some of us were born in Ireland, some have family connections,
but we all enjoy Irish literature.
We believe that poetry and certain novels are best read aloud,
that some works are better heard than read.
