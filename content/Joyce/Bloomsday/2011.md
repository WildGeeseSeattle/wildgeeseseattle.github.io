==================================

[![](../../posters/2011-Eumaeus-Poster.png)](../../posters/2011-Eumaeus-Poster.pdf "Download Eumaeus Poster")

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
Chapter 16, “Eumaeus”, adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's
*Ulysses*, on Saturday, June 11th, 7–9:30pm, at the [Good Shepherd
Center](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=7930079675223594474), 4649
Sunnyside Avenue N, Seattle, WA 98103. Donations towards costs of room
rental, posters, and props are welcome.

We had a very successful reading of the second half of the enormously
long Circe chapter at the [Good Shepherd Center last year](./2010.html).
We continue with the Eumaues chapter this year.

Eumaeus
-------

In the previous chapter, [Circe](./2010.html), Leopold Bloom accompanied
a very drunken Stephen Dedalus to a Dublin brothel, a trip that ended in
Stephen hallucinating seeing the ghost of his mother and being knocked
out in a fight with a British soldier.

Now, Bloom takes Stephen to a nearby cabman's shelter to get a cup of
coffee. The shelter has a handful of motley inhabitants, including the
keeper, one Skin-the-Goat Fitzharris, and D.B. Murphy, an old sailor and
unreliable spinner of tales.
