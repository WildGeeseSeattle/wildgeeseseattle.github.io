# The Other Bloomsday 2008 - Press Release

Now that the excitement of the Joycean Bloomsday Centenary has passed,
the Wild Geese Players of Seattle still continue their Joycean journey
(as ever kindly supported by the Irish Heritage Club).
This is the eleventh year that they are presenting staged readings of James Joyce's Ulysses.
In this year we find the story at Chapter 14, Oxen of the Sun.
It is 9pm on a mid-June evening.
Leopold Bloom attempts to visit an old friend at a maternity hospital,
and somehow manages to make a tour through every English literary style
before the twentieth century.

SATURDAY JUNE 14TH <br>
Location TBD <br>
DONATIONS AT THE DOOR
