The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
Chapter 7, “Aeolus”, and the first half of Chapter 8, “Lestrygonians”,
adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's *Ulysses*, on June 16th, 2017.

Our annual Bloomsday readings started in 1998.
After concluding *Ulysses* in 2013, we started afresh three year ago.
This year, we're reading Chapter 7, “Aeolus”,
and the first half of Chapter 8, “Lestrygonians”.

## Chapter 7: Aeolus

Chapter 7 “Aeolus” begins at noon in the *Freeman Journal*'s newspaper offices,
where Bloom is working on an advertisement.
Throughout the episode, Joyce parodies newspaper headlines of the day,
which also break the chapter into segments.
The chapter refers to the Odyssey when Aeolus, the ruler of the winds,
seals up all ill winds in a bag for Odysseus,
to contain them and ensure a smooth journey home.
But when a curious crew member opens the bag, the ill winds escape
and blow the ship back to Aeolus.

## Chapter 8: Lestrygonians

Chapter 8 “Lestrygonians” begins at 1 PM.
As lunchtime approaches, Leopold Bloom is getting hungry,
and as he makes his way through the center of Dublin,
his thoughts drift towards food.
The chapter is full of references to food,
many of them alluding to disgusting eating practices.
The chapter is inspired by Homer's depiction of the Lestrygonians,
a giant, cannibalistic tribe who devoured many of Odysseus’s men.
