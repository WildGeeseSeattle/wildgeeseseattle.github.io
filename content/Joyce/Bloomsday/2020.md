Category: 2020

The **Wild Geese Players of Seattle** will present a **staged reading** of
Chapter 11, “Sirens”,
adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's *Ulysses*.
For the first time ever,
our annual reading will be presented online
and available for all to stream on Bloomsday, June 16, 2020
here at [WildGeeseSeattle.org](https://www.WildGeeseSeattle.org/).

Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for Ulysses’ main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904
in which Ulysses is set.
Ulysses follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

Join us online for Chapter 11, Sirens,
where it is 4 pm
and the Dublin characters gather at the Ormond Hotel
by the banks of the River Liffey.
Leopold Bloom joins Father Cowley, Simon Dedalus, Richie Goulding,
Lenehan, and Ben Dollard among others
to enjoy an afternoon of songs and music,
with the divine Miss Douce and comely Miss Kennedy setting the scene.
