Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904
in which *Ulysses* is set.
*Ulysses* follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

Join us online for Chapter 11, Sirens,
where it is 4 pm
and the Dublin characters gather at the Ormond Hotel
by the banks of the River Liffey.
Leopold Bloom joins Father Cowley, Simon Dedalus, Richie Goulding,
Lenehan, and Ben Dollard among others,
to enjoy an afternoon of songs and music,
with the divine Miss Douce and the comely Miss Kennedy setting the scene.
