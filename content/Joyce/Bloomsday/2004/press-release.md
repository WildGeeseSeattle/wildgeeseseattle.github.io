# The Other Bloomsday - Press Release

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will once again be offering a
[staged reading]({filename}../2004.md)
of James Joyce's *Ulysses* called 'The Other Bloomsday'.
This is the seventh year that the group has performed the work.
This year is rather special as it is the centenary of Bloomsday,
June 16th 1904, the day immortalized by Joyce in Ulysses.
Chapter 10, The Wandering Rocks, will be performed.
This chapter has been described as a labyrinth that summarizes the day so far,
and gives premonitions of the tale to come!
The reading will be on Bloomsday, Wednesday, June 16th at 7.30pm
in the Brechemin Auditorium at the University of Washington
School of Music.
A second reading will be held on Saturday June 19th at 3pm,
at the Brechemin Auditorium.
This is the time that the chapter takes place,
so the audience can experience the experience in 'real time'!
The reading is directed by UW child psychiatrist Kieran Darragh O'Malley
and includes a multitude of local Irish diaspora and local actors.
The Bloomsday reading will be followed by a true celtic celebration
of Joyce, conversation, music and craic!
Admission is free, as always, but donations will be gratefully accepted and appreciated!
