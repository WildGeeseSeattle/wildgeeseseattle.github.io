# 20th Annual Staged Reading / Bloomsday Celebration of James Joyce’s Ulysses

The [Wild Geese Players of Seattle](https://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/)
join Bloomsday celebrations across the globe honoring Ulysses' author James Joyce.
Our 20th annual staged reading of selections from the book will be held at
7:30pm on Friday, June 16th, 2017, at
[Folio](https://www.folioseattle.org/), 314 Marion St, Seattle, WA 98104.
This year’s reading features Chapter 7, “Aeolus”, and Chapter 8, “Lestrygonians.”

Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for Ulysses’ main character, Leopold Bloom)
is a worldwide commemoration and celebration of the life of Irish writer James Joyce
and refers to the 24-hour period in 1904 in which Ulysses is set.
Ulysses follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle have presented staged readings of
Irish literature, by writers such as James Joyce and W.B. Yeats, since
1998. We are a diverse group of people with an interest in Irish
literature, and most of us are either Irish-born or have Irish
connections. We believe that poetry and certain novels are best read
aloud, that some words are better heard than read.
