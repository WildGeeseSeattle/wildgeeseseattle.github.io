# 27th Annual Staged Reading of James Joyce’s Ulysses

The [Wild Geese Players of Seattle](https://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/)
join Bloomsday celebrations across the globe
honoring *Ulysses’* author James Joyce.

For our 27th annual reading, we’ll present Episode 15, “Circe” (part one),
at 2:00pm on Saturday, June 15, 2024
at the Fremont Branch of the Seattle Public Library,
731 N. 35th St,
Seattle, WA 98103.

Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904 in which *Ulysses* is set.
*Ulysses* follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

In Episode 15, it is around midnight,
and Stephen Dedalus and his friend Lynch, both very drunk,
have entered Nighttown, Dublin’s red-light district,
in search of female companionship.
Leopold Bloom, who has some paternal feelings for Stephen,
has followed them.
This chapter is full of hallucinations and nightmares,
where Bloom confronts many of his unspoken desires
and emerges strengthened.

Since 1998, The Wild Geese Players of Seattle
have presented staged readings of Irish literature,
by writers such as James Joyce and W.B. Yeats.
The Geese are a diverse group of people
who share an interest in matters Irish.
Some of us were born in Ireland, some have family connections,
but we all enjoy Irish literature.
We believe that poetry and certain novels are best read aloud,
that some works are better heard than read.
