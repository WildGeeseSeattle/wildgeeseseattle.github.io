Category: 2022

The **Wild Geese Players of Seattle** will present a **staged reading** of
Episode 13, “Nausicaa”,
adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's *Ulysses*.
Our annual reading will be presented **in-person** (most likely)
at location TBD on date TBD (either the weekend of June 11th or June 18th).

Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904
in which *Ulysses* is set.
Joyce's ground-breaking novel follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

Join us for Episode 13, *Nausicaa*, where it is 8pm on Sandymount Beach,
and Leopold Bloom is exchanging meaningful glances with Gerty MacDowell.
