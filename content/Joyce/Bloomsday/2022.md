adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's *Ulysses*.
This year marks the centenary of the publication of *Ulysses* in 1922.

Bloomsday (Bloom's day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904
in which *Ulysses* is set.
Joyce's ground-breaking novel follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

Join us for Episode 13, “Nausicaa”, where it is 8pm on Sandymount Beach,
and Leopold Bloom is exchanging meaningful glances with Gerty MacDowell.
