The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
Chapter 17, “Ithaca”, adapted from
the 1922 edition of James Joyce's *Ulysses*,
on Saturday, June 16th, 7–9:30pm,
at [Couth Buzzard Books](http://buonobuzzard.com/main.htm),
8310 Greenwood Ave N, Seattle, WA 98103.

We had a successful reading of the Eumaeus chapter [last year]({filename}2011.md).
We continue with the Ithaca chapter this year.

## Ithaca

In the previous chapter, [Eumaeus]({filename}2011.md),
Leopold Bloom took a very drunken Stephen Dedalus to a cabman's shelter
to sober up over a cup of coffee.

Bloom returns home to 7 Eccles Street with Stephen, around 2am.
The two men discuss a wide variety of topics.
The episode is written in the form of a rigidly organized catechism,
and was reportedly Joyce's favorite episode in the novel.
The style is that of a scientific inquiry,
with questions furthering the narrative.
The deep descriptions range from questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination.
