James Joyce's novel *Ulysses* takes place on June 16th, 1904.
It follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's *alter ego*,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

The centenary of [Bloomsday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday),
June 16th, 2004, was celebrated
[worldwide](http://www.rejoycedublin2004.com "ReJoyce Dublin 2004").

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
chapter 15, "Circe", adapted from the 1922 edition of *Ulysses*.
This year, we're reading *Circe* on Saturday, June 13th, 2009, 1:00-3:45pm,
at the [University Bookstore](http://www.bookstore.washington.edu/),
4326 University Way NE, Seattle, WA 98105.
Donations towards costs of posters and props are welcome.

Stephen Dedalus and his friend Lynch, both very drunk,
have entered Nighttown, Dublin's red-light district,
in search of female companionship.
Leopold Bloom, who has some paternal feelings for Stephen, has followed them.
A long chapter full of hallucinations and nightmares,
where Bloom confronts many of his unspoken desires and emerges strengthened.
