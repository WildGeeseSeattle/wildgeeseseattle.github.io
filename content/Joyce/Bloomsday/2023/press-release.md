# 26th Annual Staged Reading of James Joyce’s Ulysses

The [Wild Geese Players of Seattle](https://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/)
join Bloomsday celebrations across the globe
honoring *Ulysses'* author James Joyce.
This year marks the centenary of the publication of *Ulysses* in 1922.

For our 26th annual reading, we’ll present Episode 13, Nausicaa,
at 2:00 pm on June 17, 2023
at the Greenwood Branch of the Seattle Public Library,
8016 Greenwood Ave N,
Seattle, WA 98103.

Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904 in which *Ulysses* is set.
*Ulysses* follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.



Since 1998, The Wild Geese Players of Seattle
have presented staged readings of Irish literature,
by writers such as James Joyce and W.B. Yeats.
The Geese are a diverse group of people
who share an interest in matters Irish.
Some of us were born in Ireland, some have family connections,
but we all enjoy Irish literature.
We believe that poetry and certain novels are best read aloud,
that some works are better heard than read.
