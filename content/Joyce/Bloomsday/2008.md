James Joyce's novel *Ulysses* takes place on June 16th, 1904.
It follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's *alter ego*,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

The centenary of [Bloomsday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday),
June 16th, 2004, was celebrated
[worldwide](http://www.rejoycedublin2004.com "ReJoyce Dublin 2004").

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
chapter 14, "Oxen of the Sun",
adapted from the 1922 edition of *Ulysses*.
The reading will take place at the
[Elliott Bay Bookstore](http://www.elliottbaybook.com/), 101 S. Main St,
on Sat 14th June 2008 at 4:00pm.

The wandering Leopold Bloom visits a maternity hospital,
where poor Mina Purefoy is entering her 3rd day of labor.
Bloom encounters a group of drunken medical students,
who carry on wildly
while discussing poor Mrs. Purefoy's fate.

In this chapter, Joyce's incomparable narrative
celebrates the history of the English language
through elaborate parodies and structures.
At the same time, he reveals much about contemporary attitudes surrounding pregnancy and birth.
