## Chapter 10: Wandering Rocks

The Wandering Rocks chapter is the only chapter of James Joyce's Ulysses
with a brief, passing structural relationship to Homer.
In Homer, Circe warns Ulysses to avoid the Wandering Rocks
because they were dangerous for sea navigation.
It is really taken from Jason and the Argonauts' story
of their perilous sea journey back to Corinth with the Golden Fleece.

Joyce was reputed to have used a compass, ruler, set square, map, and a timepiece
when he was constructing this episode.
Here we are first fully introduced to the Dublin of the early twentieth century,
a city that the book would eventually immortalize.
Neither Stephen Dedalus nor Leopold Bloom dominates the chapter.
It is Joyce's "woman-city"—Dublin—that becomes the essence of the story.

This is the central chapter of Joyce's book, offered in 19 scenes,
with the first functioning as a classic prologue and the nineteenth as an epilogue.
The Wandering Rocks serves as a bridge between the two halves of the book
and a miniature of the whole.

In true Joyce style, he used to play a board game called Labyrinth with his daughter Lucia.
What we are witnessing is that labyrinth transported to the streets of Dublin.
The characters of the city pass the mid-afternoon hour of 3–4pm.
Their comings and goings become framed between the primary journeys of Church and State.
The ambling Father Conmee represents the Roman Catholic Church,
and the cavalcade of the Governor-General of Ireland, the Earl of Dudley, represents the British State.
The chapter is quite cinematic in its visual presentation.
Its conclusion is a city crowded with people walking, talking, running and singing!
