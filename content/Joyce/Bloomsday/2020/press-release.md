# 23rd Annual Staged Reading / Virtual Bloomsday Celebration of James Joyce’s Ulysses

The [Wild Geese Players of Seattle](https://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/)
join Bloomsday celebrations across the globe honoring *Ulysses'* author James Joyce.
For the first time ever, our annual reading will be presented online
and available for all to stream on Bloomsday, June 16, 2020
at [WildGeeseSeattle.org](https://www.WildGeeseSeattle.org/).

Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904 in which *Ulysses* is set.
*Ulysses* follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

Join us online for Chapter 11, *Sirens*, where it is 4 pm
and the Dublin characters gather at the Ormond Hotel
by the banks of the River Liffey.
Leopold Bloom joins Father Cowley, Simon Dedalus, Richie Goulding,
Lenehan, and Ben Dollard among others,
to enjoy an afternoon of songs and music,
with the divine Miss Douce and comely Miss Kennedy setting the scene.

Since 1998, The Wild Geese Players of Seattle
have presented staged readings of Irish literature,
by writers such as James Joyce and W.B. Yeats.
The Geese are a diverse group of people who are Irish-born or have Irish connections,
who share an interest in Irish literature.
We believe that poetry and certain novels are best read aloud,
that some works are better heard than read.
