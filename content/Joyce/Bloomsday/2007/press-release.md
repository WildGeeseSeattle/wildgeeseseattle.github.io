# The Other Bloomsday 2007 - Press Release

Now that the excitement of the Joycean Bloomsday Centenary has passed
the Wild Geese Players of Seattle still continue their Joycean journey
(as ever kindly supported by the Irish Heritage Club). This is the tenth
year that they are presenting staged readings of James Joyce's Ulysses.
In this year we find the story at Chapter 13, Nausikaa. It is 8pm on a
mid-June afternoon, and Leopold Bloom and young Gerty MacDowell are
eyeing each other at a distance on a Dublin beach.

SATURDAY JUNE 16TH <br>
Location TBD <br>
DONATIONS AT THE DOOR
