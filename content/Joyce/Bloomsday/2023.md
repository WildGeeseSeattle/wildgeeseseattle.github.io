For our 26th annual reading,
we’ll present Episode 14, “Oxen of the Sun”,<br/>
at **2:00pm on June 17, 2023** at the<br/>

Bloomsday (Bloom's day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904
in which *Ulysses* is set.
Joyce's ground-breaking novel follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

In Episode 14 it is 10pm,
and Leopold Bloom visits a maternity hospital,
where poor Mina Purefoy is entering her 3rd day of labor.
Bloom encounters a group of drunken medical students,
who carry on wildly while discussing poor Mrs. Purefoy’s fate.
In this episode, Joyce’s incomparable narrative
celebrates the history of the English language
through elaborate parodies and structures.
At the same time, he reveals much about contemporary attitudes
surrounding pregnancy and birth.
