Our annual Bloomsday readings started in 1998.

This year, we're reading the second half of Chapter 8, “Lestrygonians”,
and all of Chapter 9, "Scylla and Charybdis".

## Chapter 8.ii: Lestrygonians

We pick up where we left off last year in the middle of Chapter 8,
as Leopold Bloom is searching for lunch.
He enters Davy Byrne's peaceful pub, gaining respite from the hubbub of Dublin.
Joyce, as ever, is preoccupied with “the significance of trivial things”,
through which we learn more about Bloom's past and how others see him.

## Chapter 9: Scylla and Charybdis

In Chapter 9, Stephen Dedalus is holding forth in the National Library of Ireland,
giving the performance of his life to an audience of
Irish writers and scholars who were part of the
[Irish Literary Revival](http://libapps.libraries.uc.edu/exhibits/irish-lit/sample-page/)
of the early 20th century.
Stephen is an outsider, desperately trying to assert himself
in front of these gatekeepers of Irish culture.
He shares his elaborate theories on the life of Shakespeare,
why the bard left his second-best bed to his widow, Anne Hathaway,
and the fatherlessness of Hamlet.
