Chapter 1, “Telemachus”, and Chapter 4, “Calypso”,
adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's *Ulysses*,
on 2pm on Sunday, June 15th, 2014,
at [The Seattle Central Library](http://www.spl.org/locations/central-library)

Donations towards costs of posters and props are welcome.

Our annual Bloomsday readings started in 1998
and last year we concluded *Ulysses* with the “Penelope” chapter.
We're starting afresh this year, with the chapters that introduce
the two primary characters of the book,
Stephen Dedalus in Chapter 1, “Telemachus”, and Leopold Bloom in Chapter 4, “Calypso”.

The Seattle Library
[recorded our reading](http://www.spl.org/Audio/14_06_15_Wild_Geese_Players.mp3).

## Chapter 1: Telemachus

“Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead”—one of the most
famous opening lines in English literature.
It's 8am on June 16th, 1904: a fine summer's day in Dublin.
Stephen Dedalus is temporarily staying with Buck Mulligan
and an Englishman at a Martello Tower south of Dublin.
Stephen is the brilliant aesthete who was the subject of James Joyce's previous novel,
*The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*.
He is at odds with his irreverent host, who mocks him;
by the end of the chapter, he will set forth across Dublin, never to return to the Tower.

## Chapter 4: Calypso

Meanwhile, Leopold Bloom is starting his day at his home at 7 Eccles Street
in Dublin's city center.
Bloom, in contrast to Stephen, is a perfectly ordinary fellow.
For now, he concerns himself with preparing breakfast for his wife, Molly,
and worrying about her lover and about their absent daughter, Milly.
We'll see deep into Bloom's head and heart over the course of this day and this book.

## Reading at the Seattle Central Library

The reading will be held in the Seattle Central Library at Level 4, Room 2
— Howard S. Wright Family & Janet W. Ketcham Meeting Room.
Please arrive before 2pm to find a seat.
The reading will take roughly 100 minutes.
