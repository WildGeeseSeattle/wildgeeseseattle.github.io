The **Wild Geese Players of Seattle** will present a **staged reading** of
Chapter 12, “Cyclops”,
adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's *Ulysses*.
Our annual reading will be presented online
and available for all to stream on Bloomsday, June 16, 2021
here at [WildGeeseSeattle.org](https://www.WildGeeseSeattle.org/).

Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904
in which *Ulysses* is set.
Joyce's ground-breaking novel follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

Join us online for Chapter 12, *Cyclops*, where it is 5pm
and a variety of Dublin characters take up space in Barney Kiernan's pub
on [Little Britain Street](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and-property/bloomsday-buy-ulysses-pub-in-dublin-7-on-the-market-for-700k-1.4277812).
Join Leopold Bloom (an outsider),
the Citizen (a xenophobe),
Garryowen (a cur),
the Narrator (a curmudgeon),
Joe Hynes (a ne'er-do-well),
Alf Bergan (a drinker),
Bob Doran (a drunk),
Terry (a barman),
and others
at the bar
for conversation and flights of fantasy.
