Chapter 18, “Penelope” aka Molly Bloom’s Soliloquy,
adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's *Ulysses*,

We had a successful reading of the Ithaca chapter [last year]({filename}2012.md).
Our annual Bloomsday readings started in 1998
and this year we conclude *Ulysses* with the Penelope chapter.

## Penelope — Molly Bloom's Soliloquy

In [Ithaca]({filename}2012.md), the previous chapter of *Ulysses*,
Leopold Bloom climbed into bed after a drunken night with Stephen Dedalus,
waking his wife, Molly.
Bloom fell asleep but Molly lies awake in the bed.
We are treated to Molly's innermost thoughts and ramblings,
rendered as a stream of consciousness,
as she recalls her youth in Gibraltar and her present day in Dublin,
the loves of her life and the consummation of her affair with Blazes Boylan,
her lusts and female woes,
and her wry affection for her exasperating husband, Poldy.

Molly is funny and foul-mouthed, frank and earthy, and caustic yet romantic.
We're looking forward to reading her story, and to seeing you listen to us.
Bring your Dad for Father's Day.

On-street parking is free on Sundays.
Walk to the back of Elliott Bay Books
and down the stairs to find the reading room.
Please arrive before 3pm to find a seat.
The reading will take roughly two-and-a-half hours.
