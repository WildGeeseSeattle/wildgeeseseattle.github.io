James Joyce's novel *Ulysses* takes place on June 16th, 1904.
It follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's *alter ego*,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

The centenary of [Bloomsday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday),
June 16th, 2004, is being celebrated
[worldwide](http://www.rejoycedublin2004.com "ReJoyce Dublin 2004").

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present staged readings of
chapter 10, "Wandering Rocks", adapted from the 1922 edition of *Ulysses*.
The readings will take place at the
[Brechemin Auditorium](http://www.music.washington.edu/facilities/index.php?pg=perf_spaces_box),

## Wandering Rocks

The Wandering Rocks chapter is the only chapter of James Joyce's Ulysses
with a brief, passing structural relationship to Homer.
In Homer, Circe warns Ulysses to avoid the Wandering Rocks
because they were dangerous for sea navigation.
It is really taken from Jason and the Argonauts' story
of their perilous sea journey back to Corinth with the Golden Fleece.

Joyce was reputed to have used a compass, ruler, set square, map and a timepiece
when he was constructing this episode.
Here we are first fully introduced to the Dublin of the early twentieth century,
a city that the book would eventually immortalise.
Neither Stephen Dedalus nor Leopold Bloom dominates the chapter.
It is Joyce's "woman-city", Dublin that becomes the essence of the story.

This is the central chapter of Joyce's book, offered in 19 scenes
with the 1st one functioning as a classic prologue
and the 19th as an epilogue.
The Wandering Rocks serves as a bridge between the two halves of the book
and a miniature of the whole.

In true Joyce style, he used to play a board game called Labyrinth with his daughter Lucia.
What we are witnessing is that labyrinth transported to the streets of Dublin.
The characters of the city pass the mid-afternoon hour of 3â€“4pm.
Their comings and goings become framed between the primary journeys of Church and State.
Father Conmee represents the Church,
and the King's Governor General and his wife the Lord and Lady Humble Dudley
represent the State.
The chapter is quite cinematic in its visual presentation.
Its conclusion is a city crowded with people walking, talking, running and singing!
