The **Wild Geese Players of Seattle** will present a **staged reading** of
Episode 15, “Circe” (part 1),
adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's *Ulysses*.
Two years ago marked the centenary of the publication of *Ulysses* in 1922.

For our 27th annual reading,
we’ll present Episode 15, “Circe” (part 1),<br/>
at **2:00pm on Saturday, June 15, 2024** at the<br/>
[Fremont Branch](https://www.spl.org/hours-and-locations/fremont-branch)
of the Seattle Public Library,<br/>
731 N. 35th St,<br/>
Seattle, WA 98103.

Bloomsday (Bloom's day, named for *Ulysses’* main character, Leopold Bloom)
refers to the 24-hour period on June 16, 1904
in which *Ulysses* is set.
Joyce's ground-breaking novel follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.

In Episode 15, it is around midnight,
and Stephen Dedalus and his friend Lynch, both very drunk,
have entered Nighttown, Dublin’s red-light district,
in search of female companionship.
Leopold Bloom, who has some paternal feelings for Stephen,
has followed them.
This chapter is full of hallucinations and nightmares,
where Bloom confronts many of his unspoken desires
and emerges strengthened.

This chapter is enormously long.
We'll read the first half this year
and the second half in 2025.
