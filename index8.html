<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will perform a staged reading of <em>Circe</em>,
chapter 15 of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>, on Saturday, June 13th, 2009, 1:00-3:45pm,
at the <a href="http://www.bookstore.washington.edu/">University Bookstore</a>,
4326 University Way <span class="caps">NE</span>, Seattle, <span class="caps">WA</span> 98105.
Donations towards costs of posters and props are&nbsp;welcome.</p>
<p>It is late on the night of June 16th, 1904, and Leopold Bloom has
followed Stephen Dedalus into Dublin&#8217;s red-light district. Bloom has a
paternal concern for Stephen&#8217;s welfare and knows that Stephen is now
very drunk. In the <em>Circe</em> chapter of Homer&#8217;s <em>Odyssey</em>, the
witch-goddess Circe transforms Odysseus&#8217; crew into swine. In Joyce&#8217;s
version, Bloom will have hallucinatory encounters with the denizens of
Nighttown and confront some of his deepest fantasies and fears, before
emerging victorious. This chapter is extraordinarily long. We will
perform the first half this year and read the second half in&nbsp;2010.</p>
<p>The Wild Geese have been staging readings of Ulysses and other Irish
literature in Seattle since 1998. We are a diverse group of people with
an interest in Irish literature, and most of us are either Irish-born or
have Irish connections. More generally, Wild Geese refers to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora">Irish
diaspora</a>, after the
original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese">Wild
Geese</a>, exiled
Irish soldiers and their descendants who served in European armies in
the 16th–18th&nbsp;centuries.</p>

                <p>Originally, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese">Flight of the Wild Geese</a>
referred to thousands of Irish soldiers who were exiled to France
after the Treaty of Limerick in 1691.
For generations, their descendants served in the Irish Brigades in the French army,
fighting against&nbsp;England.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://indigo.ie/~wildgees/index.htm">Wild Geese Heritage Museum</a>
of Portumna, Co. Galway has a large collection of Wild Geese&nbsp;material.</p>

<hr>
<p><img alt="Don Berg" src="/images/Don_Berg.jpg"></p>
<h3>Don&nbsp;Berg</h3>
<p>Born Shaun Liam Kelly, Don Berg has been a member of the Wild Geese
since 2001, though he missed 2003&#8217;s production while on active duty for
the Global War on Terror. In real life he works at <span class="caps">UW</span> School of Nursing
and is a Naval Reserve Officer. As a denizen of the local art scene, Don
has appeared in local theater production and local and regional <span class="caps">TV</span> ad
commercial&nbsp;productions.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="Olivia Bermingham-McDonogh" src="/images/Olivia_Bermingham-McDonogh.jpg"></p>
<h3>Olivia&nbsp;Bermingham-McDonogh</h3>
<p>Olivia Bermingham-McDonogh was born in Tuam, Co. Galway and came to the
<span class="caps">USA</span> for graduate school at <span class="caps">UCLA</span>. Other than the required school plays,
she has never performed in anything other than the annual Bloomsday
reading of Ulysses. She is a Research Assistant Professor at the
University of Washington; her research area is development and
regeneration of the inner ear. She has now spent half her life in the <span class="caps">US</span>
and wonders if she will ever find her way back&nbsp;home!</p>
<hr>
<h3>Tina&nbsp;Bonfield</h3>
<p>in seattle was a stage manager for the <span class="caps">DAMN</span> group, of local playwrights;
putting on two productions a year, for 3 years. Have been involved with
the Geese, for about 5 year? in production,front of house and small
parts. I work as a caregiver,full&nbsp;time.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Helen&nbsp;Brew</h3>
<p>Helen Brew has performed with the Wild Geese Players since June 2000
(which was chapter 4). In her youth she was an avid reader and artist,
though she fitted in bits of acting, stage writing, directing, theatre
design and choral performance. Her paid work has included writing a book
on compost, and doing neuroscience research (<span class="caps">UW</span>). She&#8217;s English, but has
some Irish ancestry she tries to play up. She directed 2007&#8217;s&nbsp;reading.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="Ellen Coyle" src="/images/Coyle_Ellen_001.jpg"></p>
<h3>Ellen&nbsp;Coyle</h3>
<p>Ellen Coyle is an Irish artist living and working in Seattle. She
attended the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, the Cooper
Union in New York and completed the Scientific Illustration program at
the University of Washington in 2004. She is currently working on

we create about&nbsp;them.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="Maura Donegan" src="/images/Maura_Donegan.jpg"></p>

<p>Maura Donegan has lived in Seattle for the last six years. This is her
first reading, although she was involved with the original Wild Geese
(Edmonton) assisting with costumes. Her interests include textiles and
embroidery. Maura is from Ireland. She has three children whom she
educated at&nbsp;home.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Iain&nbsp;Edgewater</h3>
<p>Iain Edgewater was raised on the fringes of Appalachia in Kentucky, and
was first exposed to Joyce in boyhood, strangely, through science
fiction. After years of reading Ulysses in bits and pieces, he finally
read it straight through while living in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1992&#8212;a very
good time and place for the task. Like many trained in anthropology, he
does not work as an anthropologist; instead, he is now one of the people
involved with occasionally rebooting your computer in the middle of the
night, if you happen to use a rather well-known operating system. After
much time threatening to begin writing fiction (concurrent with early
dabbling in acting, and later involvement in radio), he is finally doing
so, and is thus pleased to have finally begun reading with the <span class="caps">WGP</span> in
this cycle&#8212;since the shadow of Joyce looms large over his&nbsp;efforts.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Claudia&nbsp;Finn</h3>
<p>Claudia’s Irish ancestors came to the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> in 1872 (!). A theatre buff,
Francophile, and James Joyce fan, she joined the Wild Geese in 2008.
After a career writing, producing, and directing corporate videos,
multimedia, and print, she taught college courses in business and
technology. Since moving to Seattle in 2003, she works as a technical
trainer, training developer, writer and&nbsp;editor.</p>
<hr>

ago) and has lived in the <span class="caps">US</span> for two decades, moving to Washington in
2004. He studied Medicine in Trinity College Dublin, and researched and
practiced nephrology in Boston and New Mexico before coming to the
Northwest. 2008 will be his first reading with the Wild&nbsp;Geese.</p>
<hr>

Sarsfield. A true wild goose, the exile toiled years in the service of
far-flung potentates&#8230;.<span class="caps">B.B.</span> Hindowa <span class="caps">IV</span> of Ngelehun-Badjia, Habib

V, a <span class="caps">WWII</span> freighter, and cargo ships the world over, from the Strait of
Gibraltar to Singapore. In 2006, she won First Prize at the Seattle
Maritime Festival&#8217;s &#8220;Songs and Stories of the Sea&#8221;&nbsp;contest.</p>

since 1989. She is a presenter of the popular Celtic music radio program

<p>James Joyce&#8217;s novel <em>Ulysses</em> takes place on June 16th, 1904.
It follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce&#8217;s <em>alter ego</em>,
as they wander the streets of&nbsp;Dublin.</p>
<p>The centenary of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday">Bloomsday</a>,
June 16th, 2004, was celebrated
<a href="http://www.rejoycedublin2004.com" title="ReJoyce Dublin 2004">worldwide</a>.</p>
<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
chapter 14, &#8220;Oxen of the Sun&#8221;,
adapted from the 1922 edition of <em>Ulysses</em>.
The reading will take place at the
<a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/">Elliott Bay Bookstore</a>, 101 S. Main St,
on Sat 14th June 2008 at&nbsp;4:00pm.</p>
<p>The wandering Leopold Bloom visits a maternity hospital,
where poor Mina Purefoy is entering her 3rd day of labor.
Bloom encounters a group of drunken medical students,
who carry on wildly
while discussing poor Mrs. Purefoy&#8217;s&nbsp;fate.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Joyce&#8217;s incomparable narrative
celebrates the history of the English language
through elaborate parodies and structures.
At the same time, he reveals much about contemporary attitudes surrounding pregnancy and&nbsp;birth.</p>

<p>Now that the excitement of the Joycean Bloomsday Centenary has passed,
the Wild Geese Players of Seattle still continue their Joycean journey
(as ever kindly supported by the Irish Heritage Club).
This is the eleventh year that they are presenting staged readings of James Joyce&#8217;s Ulysses.
In this year we find the story at Chapter 14, Oxen of the Sun.
It is 9pm on a mid-June evening.
Leopold Bloom attempts to visit an old friend at a maternity hospital,
and somehow manages to make a tour through every English literary style
before the twentieth&nbsp;century.</p>
