<h1>Seattle&nbsp;Bloomsday</h1>
<p>James Joyce&#8217;s novel <em>Ulysses</em> takes place on June 16th, 1904.
It follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman, and Stephen Dedalus,
a young writer and Joyce&#8217;s <em>alter ego</em>, as they wander the streets of&nbsp;Dublin.</p>
<p>The centenary of Bloomsday, June 16th, 2004, was celebrated&nbsp;worldwide.</p>
<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a <a href="/the-other-bloomsday-seattle-2014.html" title="The Other Bloomsday">staged
reading</a> of <em>Ulysses</em>,
chapter 1, “Telemachus”, and chapter 4, “Calypso”, on Sun 15th June
2014, at the Seattle Central&nbsp;Library.</p>

                <p>Originally, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese">Flight of the Wild Geese</a>
referred to thousands of Irish soldiers who were exiled to France
after the Treaty of Limerick in 1691.
For generations, their descendants served in the Irish Brigades in the French army,
fighting against&nbsp;England.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://indigo.ie/~wildgees/index.htm">Wild Geese Heritage Museum</a>
of Portumna, Co. Galway has a large collection of Wild Geese&nbsp;material.</p>
<p>More generally, the term &#8220;Wild Geese&#8221; has become synonymous with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora">Irish diaspora</a>.</p>
<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle are a diverse group of people who
share a common interest in Irish literature.
Some of us were born in Ireland,
some of us are of Irish descent,
and some of us are honorary&nbsp;Irish!</p>
<p>Here are past and current members of the&nbsp;Players.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Bill&nbsp;Barnes</h3>
<p><img alt="Bill Barnes" src="/images/Bill_Barnes.jpg"></p>

She has had a varied career and now works as a software tester. 2008
marks her fifth year with the Players. She is married to <a href="#George-Reilly">George
Reilly</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="Don Berg" src="/images/Don_Berg.jpg"></p>
<h3>Don&nbsp;Berg</h3>
<p>Born Shaun Liam Kelly, Don Berg has been a member of the Wild Geese
since 2001, though he missed 2003&#8217;s production while on active duty for
the Global War on Terror. In real life he works at <span class="caps">UW</span> School of Nursing
and is a Naval Reserve Officer. As a denizen of the local art scene, Don
has appeared in local theater production and local and regional <span class="caps">TV</span> ad
commercial&nbsp;productions.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="Olivia Bermingham-McDonogh" src="/images/Olivia_Bermingham-McDonogh.jpg"></p>
<h3>Olivia&nbsp;Bermingham-McDonogh</h3>
<p>Olivia Bermingham-McDonogh was born in Tuam, Co. Galway and came to the
<span class="caps">USA</span> for graduate school at <span class="caps">UCLA</span>. Other than the required school plays,
she has never performed in anything other than the annual Bloomsday
reading of Ulysses. She is a Research Assistant Professor at the
University of Washington; her research area is development and
regeneration of the inner ear. She has now spent half her life in the <span class="caps">US</span>
and wonders if she will ever find her way back&nbsp;home!</p>
<hr>
<h3>Tina&nbsp;Bonfield</h3>
<p>in seattle was a stage manager for the <span class="caps">DAMN</span> group, of local playwrights;
putting on two productions a year, for 3 years. Have been involved with
the Geese, for about 5 year? in production,front of house and small
parts. I work as a caregiver,full&nbsp;time.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Helen&nbsp;Brew</h3>
<p>Helen Brew has performed with the Wild Geese Players since June 2000
(which was chapter 4). In her youth she was an avid reader and artist,
though she fitted in bits of acting, stage writing, directing, theatre
design and choral performance. Her paid work has included writing a book
on compost, and doing neuroscience research (<span class="caps">UW</span>). She&#8217;s English, but has
some Irish ancestry she tries to play up. She directed 2007&#8217;s&nbsp;reading.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="Ellen Coyle" src="/images/Coyle_Ellen_001.jpg"></p>
<h3>Ellen&nbsp;Coyle</h3>
<p>Ellen Coyle is an Irish artist living and working in Seattle. She
attended the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, the Cooper
Union in New York and completed the Scientific Illustration program at
the University of Washington in 2004. She is currently working on
several projects which explore the landscapes we live in, and the myths
we create about&nbsp;them.</p>
<hr>
<p><img alt="Maura Donegan" src="/images/Maura_Donegan.jpg"></p>
<h3>Maura&nbsp;Donegan</h3>
<p>Maura Donegan has lived in Seattle for the last six years. This is her
first reading, although she was involved with the original Wild Geese
(Edmonton) assisting with costumes. Her interests include textiles and
embroidery. Maura is from Ireland. She has three children whom she
educated at&nbsp;home.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Iain&nbsp;Edgewater</h3>
<p>Iain Edgewater was raised on the fringes of Appalachia in Kentucky, and
was first exposed to Joyce in boyhood, strangely, through science
fiction. After years of reading Ulysses in bits and pieces, he finally
read it straight through while living in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1992&#8212;a very
good time and place for the task. Like many trained in anthropology, he
does not work as an anthropologist; instead, he is now one of the people
involved with occasionally rebooting your computer in the middle of the
night, if you happen to use a rather well-known operating system. After
much time threatening to begin writing fiction (concurrent with early
dabbling in acting, and later involvement in radio), he is finally doing
so, and is thus pleased to have finally begun reading with the <span class="caps">WGP</span> in
this cycle&#8212;since the shadow of Joyce looms large over his&nbsp;efforts.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Claudia&nbsp;Finn</h3>
<p>Claudia’s Irish ancestors came to the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> in 1872 (!). A theatre buff,
Francophile, and James Joyce fan, she joined the Wild Geese in 2008.
After a career writing, producing, and directing corporate videos,
multimedia, and print, she taught college courses in business and
technology. Since moving to Seattle in 2003, she works as a technical
trainer, training developer, writer and&nbsp;editor.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Mark&nbsp;Gunning</h3>
<p>Mark Gunning, was born and reared in Dublin (more than half a century
ago) and has lived in the <span class="caps">US</span> for two decades, moving to Washington in
2004. He studied Medicine in Trinity College Dublin, and researched and
practiced nephrology in Boston and New Mexico before coming to the
Northwest. 2008 will be his first reading with the Wild&nbsp;Geese.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Red&nbsp;Johnston</h3>
<p>A native of Limerick, Redmond fled the city a few brief centuries after
Sarsfield. A true wild goose, the exile toiled years in the service of
far-flung potentates&#8230;.<span class="caps">B.B.</span> Hindowa <span class="caps">IV</span> of Ngelehun-Badjia, Habib
Bourguiba, Mohamed Reza Pahlavi, Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Bill

Geese Players&#8217; previous Ulysses readings. She holds Masters degrees in
English from <span class="caps">UCLA</span> (Thesis: <em>Yeats and the Ancient Irish Poets</em>) and the
<span class="caps">UW</span>, where she studied Joyce&#8217;s Ulysses with renowned Celtic scholar
Hazard Adams. She has crewed the tall ship Lady Washington, the Virginia
V, a <span class="caps">WWII</span> freighter, and cargo ships the world over, from the Strait of
Gibraltar to Singapore. In 2006, she won First Prize at the Seattle
Maritime Festival&#8217;s &#8220;Songs and Stories of the Sea&#8221;&nbsp;contest.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Mary&nbsp;Kelly</h3>
<p>Mary Kelly hails from Cork City, Ireland, and has been living in Seattle
since 1989. She is a presenter of the popular Celtic music radio program

for 30 years. He is a member of the Red Earth Performing Arts theater

after the battle in 1601, the original Flight of the Earls set out! He
is currently a doctoral student at the University of Washington College
of Education, from where he wishes to learn Americans how to speak
English with the proper Cork intonation. He is convinced that if Joyce
