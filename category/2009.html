                <p>James Joyce&#8217;s novel <em>Ulysses</em> takes place on June 16th, 1904.
It follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce&#8217;s <em>alter ego</em>,
as they wander the streets of&nbsp;Dublin.</p>
<p>The centenary of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday">Bloomsday</a>,
June 16th, 2004, was celebrated
<a href="http://www.rejoycedublin2004.com" title="ReJoyce Dublin 2004">worldwide</a>.</p>
<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
chapter 15, &#8220;Circe&#8221;, adapted from the 1922 edition of <em>Ulysses</em>.
This year, we&#8217;re reading <em>Circe</em> on Saturday, June 13th, 2009, 1:00-3:45pm,
at the <a href="http://www.bookstore.washington.edu/">University Bookstore</a>,
4326 University Way <span class="caps">NE</span>, Seattle, <span class="caps">WA</span> 98105.
Donations towards costs of posters and props are&nbsp;welcome.</p>
<p>Stephen Dedalus and his friend Lynch, both very drunk,
have entered Nighttown, Dublin&#8217;s red-light district,
in search of female companionship.
Leopold Bloom, who has some paternal feelings for Stephen, has followed them.
A long chapter full of hallucinations and nightmares,
where Bloom confronts many of his unspoken desires and emerges&nbsp;strengthened.</p>
<p>Entrance is free, but donations are&nbsp;appreciated.</p>
<p>Further background information on the Circe chapter can be found at the

<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will perform a staged reading of <em>Circe</em>,
chapter 15 of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>, on Saturday, June 13th, 2009, 1:00-3:45pm,
at the <a href="http://www.bookstore.washington.edu/">University Bookstore</a>,

<p>It is late on the night of June 16th, 1904, and Leopold Bloom has
followed Stephen Dedalus into Dublin&#8217;s red-light district. Bloom has a
paternal concern for Stephen&#8217;s welfare and knows that Stephen is now
very drunk. In the <em>Circe</em> chapter of Homer&#8217;s <em>Odyssey</em>, the
witch-goddess Circe transforms Odysseus&#8217; crew into swine. In Joyce&#8217;s
version, Bloom will have hallucinatory encounters with the denizens of
Nighttown and confront some of his deepest fantasies and fears, before
emerging victorious. This chapter is extraordinarily long. We will
perform the first half this year and read the second half in&nbsp;2010.</p>
<p>The Wild Geese have been staging readings of Ulysses and other Irish
literature in Seattle since 1998. We are a diverse group of people with
an interest in Irish literature, and most of us are either Irish-born or
have Irish connections. More generally, Wild Geese refers to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora">Irish
diaspora</a>, after the
original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese">Wild
Geese</a>, exiled
Irish soldiers and their descendants who served in European armies in
the 16th–18th&nbsp;centuries.</p>
