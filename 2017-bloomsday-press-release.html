                <h1>20th Annual Staged Reading / Bloomsday Celebration of James Joyce’s&nbsp;Ulysses</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/index.html">Wild Geese Players of Seattle</a>
join Bloomsday celebrations across the globe honoring Ulysses&#8217; author James Joyce.
Our 20th annual staged reading of selections from the book will be held at
7:30pm on Friday, June 16th, 2017, at
<a href="http://www.folioseattle.org/">Folio</a>, 314 Marion St, Seattle, <span class="caps">WA</span> 98104.
This year’s reading features Chapter 7, “Aeolus”, and Chapter 8,&nbsp;“Lestrygonians.”</p>
<p>Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for Ulysses’ main character, Leopold Bloom)
is a worldwide commemoration and celebration of the life of Irish writer James Joyce
and refers to the 24-hour period in 1904 in which Ulysses is set.
Ulysses follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce&#8217;s alter ego,
as they wander the streets of&nbsp;Dublin.</p>
<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle have presented staged readings of
Irish literature, by writers such as James Joyce and <span class="caps">W.B.</span> Yeats, since
1998. We are a diverse group of people with an interest in Irish
literature, and most of us are either Irish-born or have Irish
connections. We believe that poetry and certain novels are best read
aloud, that some words are better heard than&nbsp;read.</p>
