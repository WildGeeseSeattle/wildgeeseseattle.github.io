One of Ireland's greatest writers, [James
Joyce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce) is best known for his
novels, [A Portrait of the Artist as a Young
Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man),

The Other Bloomsday
-------------------

James Joyce's novel *Ulysses* takes place on June 16th, 1904. It follows
the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman, and Stephen Dedalus,
a young writer and Joyce's *alter ego*, as they wander the streets of
Dublin.

The centenary of Bloomsday, June 16th, 2004, was celebrated worldwide.

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a [staged
reading](./Bloomsday/2014.html "The Other Bloomsday") of *Ulysses*,
chapter 1, “Telemachus”, and chapter 4, “Calypso”, on Sun 15th June
2014, at the Seattle Central Library.

See our [Bloomsday page](./Bloomsday/index.html). See our
[archives](../archives.html) of our previous readings.
