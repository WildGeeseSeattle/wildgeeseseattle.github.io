<p>James Joyce's novel <em>Ulysses</em> takes place on June 16th, 1904.
It follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman, and
Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's <em>alter ego</em>,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.</p>

<p>The centenary of Bloomsday, June 16th, 2004, was celebrated
worldwide.</p>

<em>Ulysses</em>,
chapter 3, “Proteus”, and chapter 6, “Hades”, on Sunday, June 19th, 2016,
at the Seattle Central Library.
