The Other Bloomsday 2005 - Press Release
========================================

Now that the excitement of the Joycean Bloomsday Centenary has passed
the Wild Geese Players of Seattle still continue their Joycean journey
(as ever kindly supported by the Irish Heritage Club). This is the
eighth year that they are presenting staged readings of James Joyce's
Ulysses. In this year we find the story at Chapter 11, The Sirens. It is
4 pm on a mid June afternoon and the Dublin characters gather at the
Ormonde Hotel by the banks of the River Liffey. Leopold Bloom joins
Father Cowley, Simon Dedalus, Richie Goulding, Lenehan and Ben Dollard
among others to enjoy an afternoon of songs and music with the divine
Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy setting the scene!
