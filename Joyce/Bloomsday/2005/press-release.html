<h1>The Other Bloomsday 2005 - Press Release</h1>

<p>Now that the excitement of the Joycean Bloomsday Centenary has passed the
Wild Geese Players of Seattle still continue their Joycean journey (as
ever kindly supported by the Irish Heritage Club).
This is the eighth year that they are presenting staged readings of
James Joyce's Ulysses. In this year we find the story at
Chapter 11, The Sirens. It is 4 pm on a mid June
afternoon and the Dublin characters gather at the Ormonde Hotel by the
banks of the River Liffey. Leopold Bloom joins Father Cowley, Simon
Dedalus, Richie Goulding, Lenehan and Ben Dollard among others to enjoy an
afternoon of songs and  music with the divine Miss Douce and Miss Kennedy
setting the scene!</p>

<p>THURSDAY JUNE 16TH, 8PM<br>
SATURDAY JUNE 18TH, 4PM<br>
