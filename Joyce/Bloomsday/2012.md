[![](../../posters/ithaca-poster.png)](../../posters/ithaca-poster.pdf "Download Ithaca Poster")

The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
Chapter 17, “Ithaca”, adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's
*Ulysses*, on Saturday, June 16th, 7–9:30pm, at [Couth Buzzard
Books](http://buonobuzzard.com/main.htm), 8310 Greenwood Ave N, Seattle,
WA 98103. Donations towards costs of room rental, posters, and props are
welcome.

We had a successful reading of the Eumaeus chapter [last
year](./2011.html). We continue with the Ithaca chapter this year.

Ithaca
------

In the previous chapter, [Eumaeus](./2011.html), Leopold Bloom took a
very drunken Stephen Dedalus to a cabman's shelter to sober up over a
cup of coffee.

Bloom returns home to 7 Eccles Street with Stephen, around 2AM. The two
men discuss a wide variety of topics. The episode is written in the form
of a rigidly organized catechism, and was reportedly Joyce's favorite
episode in the novel. The style is that of a scientific inquiry, with
questions furthering the narrative. The deep descriptions range from
questions of astronomy to the trajectory of urination.
