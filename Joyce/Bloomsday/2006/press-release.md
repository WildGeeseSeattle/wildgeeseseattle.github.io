The Other Bloomsday 2006 - Press Release
========================================

Now that the excitement of the Joycean Bloomsday Centenary has passed
the Wild Geese Players of Seattle still continue their Joycean journey
(as ever kindly supported by the Irish Heritage Club). This is the ninth
year that they are presenting staged readings of James Joyce's Ulysses.
In this year we find the story at Chapter 12, The Sirens. It is 5 pm on
a mid-June afternoon and the Dublin characters gather at Barney
Kiernan's pub. Leopold Bloom joins the Citizen and a crowd of others, as
they discuss the state of the world.

FRIDAY JUNE 16TH, 8PM\
 F.X. McRORY'S,\
 OCCIDENTAL & KING, PIONEER SQUARE,\
 DONATIONS AT THE DOOR
