<h1>The Other Bloomsday - Press Release</h1>

<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will once again be offering a
<a href="./2004.html">staged reading</a>
of James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> called 'The Other Bloomsday'.
This is the seventh year that the group has performed the work.  This year
is rather special as it is the centenary of Bloomsday, June 16th 1904, the
day immortalized by Joyce in Ulysses.  Chapter 10, The Wandering Rocks,
will be performed.  This chapter has been described as a labyrinth that
summarizes the day so far, and gives premonitions of the tale to come!  The
reading will be on Bloomsday, Wednesday, June 16th at 7.30pm in the
Brechemin Auditorium at the University of Washington School of Music.  A
second reading will be held on Saturday June 19th at 3pm, at the Brechemin
Auditorium.  This is the time that the chapter takes place, so the audience
can experience the experience in 'real time'!  The reading is directed by
UW child psychiatrist Kieran Darragh O'Malley and includes a multitude of
local Irish diaspora and local actors.  The Bloomsday reading will be
followed by a true celtic celebration of Joyce, conversation, music and
craic!  Admission is free, as always, but donations will be gratefully
accepted and appreciated!  </p>
