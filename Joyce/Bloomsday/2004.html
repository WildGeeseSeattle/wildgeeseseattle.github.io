<h2>Wandering Rocks</h2>

<p>The Wandering Rocks chapter is the only chapter of James
Joyce's Ulysses with a brief, passing structural
relationship to Homer.  In Homer, Circe warns Ulysses to
avoid the Wandering Rocks because they were dangerous for
sea navigation.  It is really taken from Jason and the
Argonauts' story of their perilous sea journey back to
Corinth with the Golden Fleece.</p>

<p>Joyce was reputed to have used a compass, ruler, set square,
map and a timepiece when he was constructing this episode.
Here we are first fully introduced to the Dublin of the
early twentieth century, a city that the book would
eventually immortalise.  Neither Stephen Dedalus nor Leopold
Bloom dominates the chapter.  It is Joyce's "woman-city",
Dublin that becomes the essence of the story.</p>

<p>This is the central chapter of Joyce's book, offered in 19
scenes with the 1st one functioning as a classic prologue
and the 19th as an epilogue.  The Wandering Rocks serves as
a bridge between the two halves of the book and a miniature
of the whole.</p>

<p>In true Joyce style, he used to play a board game called
Labyrinth with his daughter Lucia.  What we are witnessing
is that labyrinth transported to the streets of Dublin.  The
characters of the city pass the mid-afternoon hour of 3-4
p.m.  Their comings and goings become framed between the
primary journeys of  Church and State.  Father Conmee
represents the Church, and the King's Governor General and
his wife the Lord and Lady Humble Dudley represent the
State.  The chapter is quite cinematic in its visual
presentation.  Its conclusion is a city crowded with people
walking, talking running and singing!</p>
