<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2>

<h2>Seattle, WA – May 7, 2017</h2>

<h2>20th Annual Staged Reading / Bloomsday Celebration of James Joyce’s Ulysses</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.wildgeeseseattle.org/index.html">Wild Geese Players of Seattle</a>
join Bloomsday celebrations across the globe honoring Ulysses' author James Joyce.
Our 20th annual staged reading of selections from the book
will be held at 7:30pm on Friday, June 16th, 2017, at
<a href="http://www.folioseattle.org/">Folio</a>,
314 Marion St, Seattle, WA 98104.
This year’s reading features Chapter&nbsp;7 “Aeolus” and Chapter&nbsp;8 “Lestrygonians.”
</p>

<p>
Bloomsday (Bloom’s day, named for Ulysses’ main character, Leopold Bloom)
is a worldwide commemoration and celebration of the life of
Irish writer James Joyce and refers to the 24-hour period in 1904 in which Ulysses is set.
Ulysses follows the wanderings of Bloom, a Jewish everyman,
and Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's alter ego,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.
</p>

<p>
The Wild Geese Players of Seattle have presented staged readings of Irish literature,
by writers such as James Joyce and W.B. Yeats, since 1998.
We are a diverse group of people with an interest in Irish literature,
and most of us are either Irish-born or have Irish connections.
We believe that poetry and certain novels are best read aloud,
that some words are better heard than read.
