<h1>The Other Bloomsday 2013 - Press Release</h1>

<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
Chapter 18, <a href="../2013.html">“Penelope”</a> aka Molly Bloom’s Soliloquy,
adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>,
on 3pm on Sunday, June 16th, 2013,
at <a href="http://www.elliottbaybook.com/">The Elliott Bay Book Company</a>,
1521 Tenth Avenue, Seattle, WA 98122.
Donations towards costs of posters and props are welcome.</p>

<p>
It's 2am on June 17th, 1904, and Molly Bloom lies awake in the bed.
We are treated to Molly's innermost thoughts and ramblings,
rendered as a stream of consciousness, as she recalls her youth
in Gibraltar and her present day in Dublin,
the loves of her life and the consummation of her affair
with Blazes Boylan, her lusts and female woes,
and her wry affection for her exasperating husband, Leopold Bloom.
</p>

<p>
Molly is funny and foul-mouthed, frank and earthy, and caustic yet romantic.
We're looking forward to reading her story, and to seeing you listen to us.
</p>

<p>The Wild Geese have been staging readings of Ulysses
and other Irish literature in Seattle since 1998.
We are a diverse group of people with an interest in Irish literature,
and most of us are either Irish-born or have Irish connections.
More generally, Wild Geese refers to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_diaspora">Irish diaspora</a>,
after the original
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_of_the_Wild_Geese">Wild Geese</a>,
exiled Irish soldiers and their descendants
who served in European armies in the 16th–18th centuries.</p>
