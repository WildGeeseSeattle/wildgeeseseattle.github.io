<h1>The Other Bloomsday 2016 — Press Release</h1>

<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
Chapter 3, “Proteus”, and Chapter 5, “Hades”,
adapted from the 1922 edition of James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>,
on 2pm on Sunday, June 19th, 2016,
at <a href="http://www.spl.org/locations/central-library" target="_blank">
The Seattle Central Library</a>, 1000 Fourth Ave, Seattle, WA 98104
[<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=1000+Fourth+Avenue,+Seattle,+WA+98104"
    target="_blank">Map</a>].
Donations towards costs of posters and props are welcome.</p>

<p>
For this year’s reading of Ulysses, the Wild Geese Players are
continuing the last two years’ approach of following Joyce’s timeline for June 16th,
rather than reading the chapters in strict linear order.
We’ll once again interweave the texts to highlight the parallel journeys of
Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus during the novel’s eleven o’clock hour.
</p>

<p>
In chapter 3 (“Proteus”), Stephen Dedalus,
...
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, in chapter 6 (“Hades”),
Leopold Bloom ...
</p>

<p>The reading is expected to take about 120 minutes.</p>

<p>The Wild Geese Players perform staged readings of Irish literature,
by writers such as James Joyce and W.B. Yeats,
throughout the Seattle area.
We are a diverse group of people with an interest in Irish literature,
and most of us are either Irish-born or have Irish connections.
More generally, the Wild Geese refers to the Irish diaspora,
after the original Wild Geese,
exiled Irish soldiers and their descendants who served in European armies
in the 16th–18th centuries.</p>
