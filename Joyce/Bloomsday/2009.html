<p>James Joyce's novel <em>Ulysses</em> takes place on June 16th, 1904.
It follows the wanderings of Leopold Bloom, a Jewish everyman, and
Stephen Dedalus, a young writer and Joyce's <em>alter ego</em>,
as they wander the streets of Dublin.</p>

<p>The centenary of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday">Bloomsday</a>,
June 16th, 2004, was celebrated
<a href="http://www.rejoycedublin2004.com" title="ReJoyce Dublin 2004">
worldwide</a>.</p>

<p>The Wild Geese Players of Seattle will present a staged reading of
chapter 15, "Circe", adapted from the 1922 edition of <em>Ulysses</em>.
This year, we're reading <em>Circe</em>
on Saturday, June 13th, 2009, 1:00-3:45pm,
at the <a href="http://www.bookstore.washington.edu/">University Bookstore</a>,
4326 University Way NE, Seattle, WA 98105.
Donations towards costs of posters and props are welcome.</p>

<p>
Stephen Dedalus and his friend Lynch, both very drunk,
have entered Nighttown, Dublin's red-light district,
in search of female companionship.
Leopold Bloom, who has some paternal feelings for Stephen,
has followed them.
A long chapter full of hallucinations and nightmares,
where Bloom confronts many of his unspoken desires
and emerges strengthened.
